# tb-rnap-subpopulations
Are resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in the RNAP polymerase less likely to have a compensatory mutation if they are only present as part of a subpopulation?

Draft plan
* look at 2x2 where split is has rpoB RAV at â‰¥90%, < 90% FRS and has/has not compensatory mutations according to your previous paper
* if there is something, then break out by (i) proportion of FRS, (ii) different RAVs, (iii) look at %growth
